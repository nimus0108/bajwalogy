									<h2>The Cell Cycle</h2>
								</header>
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/cell-cycle.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3 id="interphase">Interphase - The longest phase of the cell cycle</h3>
                                <p>The first part of the cell cycle is interphase. Interphase is divided into three phases, G1, S, and G2.                                      The G1 phase is named G because it is the first gap, and growth stage. In G1, the cells carries out its                                      normal duties in addition to growing. The 'S' stands for synthesis. During the S phase, the chromosomes                                      are duplicated. G2 is the second gap, and growth stage. Lastly, during G2, the cell grows even more, and                                      it produces organelles and proteins needed to divide.</p>
								<h3>The M phase</h3>
								<p>After interphase is the M phase. The M phase consists of two phases, mitosis and cytosynthesis. Mitosis is                                 nuclear division, while cytosynthesis is the division of the cytoplasm. </p>
                                <p>Mitosis, nuclear division, consists of four stages, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Cells undergo mitosis for growth and repair and renewal of cells. In mitosis, the number of chromosomes or the amount of DNA does not change. For example, when a diploid undergoes mitosis, it starts with 2n and ends with 2n amount of chromosomes.Mitosis divides one cell into two identical daughter cells. It only goes through one division. Furthur and more detailed information about mitosis can be found <a href="#mitosis"><strong>below</strong></a>.</p>
								<p>Cytokinesis is where the cell division is coming to an end. Animal cells and plant cells have different ways of undergoing cytokinesis. For animal cells, the cytoplasm pinches in to form the cleavage furrow, and it keeps pinching in until the cell is divided. For plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle. Vesicles from the golgi line up at the equator, and they form two cell membranes. Then a new cell wall is made in between the membranes, and it fuses with the already existing cell wall.</p>
                                <h3>Uncontrolled mitosis</h3>
                                <p>If mitosis is not controlled, cell division might happen over and over again, causing cancerous tumors.</p>

										<h3>Prophase</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Prophase is the first stage of mitosis. In this phase, chromosomes appear, and the nuclear envelope and nucleolus disappears. Centrosomes appear next to where the nucleus was, and centrioles appear in animal cells. They move to the poles and spindles form. </p>

										<h3>Metaphase</h3>

									<p>Metaphase, the second phase of mitosis is a relatively short phase. The replicated chromosomes now line up across the equator. Then, the spindle fibers attach to the chromosomes.</p>

										<h3>Anaphase</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Anaphase is the shortest phase of mitosis. Here, sister chromatids split at the centromere, and move to the poles. The chromatids can now be referred to as a chromosome.</p>

										<h3>Telophase</h3>
									</header>
									<p>First, the chromosomes begin to go back to the form of a chromatin. The nuclear envelope reforms, surrounding the chromosomes, and the nucleolus reappears. The spindles break apart until they are no longer exsitant, and the cell starts to divide. The cell begins to squeeze in the middle, forming the cleavage furrow.</p>

								</header>
								<h3>What kinds of cells undergo meiosis?</h3>
                                <p>Sex cells are produced by meiosis. Cells that undergo meiosis are diploids, and they result in haploids. Meiosis is also a process of nuclear division, but it is different than mitosis because it results in half the amount of chromosomes in the resulting cells than the original cell. It produces four haploid cells. Meiosis is used to produce gametes (sperm and eggs). It consists of a total of two divisions. During the first division, homologous chromosomes divide, which reduces the chromosome number from 2n to n. During the second division, the chromatids divide, so the chromosome number in each of the four resulting cells are n.</p>
                                <p>Overall, meiosis does three critical things. First, it reduces the number of chromosomes in gametes so that when an egg and a sperm combined during fertilization, they would have 46 chromosomes. Next, it ensures that no gamete has no more than one chromosome from each homologous pair. Lastly, it ensures that genes recombine through genetic recombination.</p>
                                <p>Meiosis occurs through two major cycles, Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Detailed information about the steps of meiosis can be found <a href="#meiosis-e"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

										<h3>Prophase I</h3>
									</header>
                                    <p>Similar to mitosis, the DNA coils into chromosomes, spindle fibers appear, and the nuclear membrane and nucleolus are gone. Then homologous chromosomes pair together to form a <strong>tetrad</strong>. This process is called <strong>synapsis</strong>. During synapsis, chromatids of a tetrad twist around each other in a process called <strong>crossing over</strong>. This allows for the genetic material to exchange between the maternal genes and the paternal genes. This is an example of <strong>genetic recombination</strong>.</p>

										<h3>Anaphase I</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Each homologous chromosome from each tetrad moves to the opposite pole of the cell. As the tetrads seperate, <strong>independant assortment</strong> occurs, causing genetic recombination. Independant assortment is the random seperation of the homologous chromosomes. The formula for the calculating the different ways that the independant assortment can result in is 2 to the nth power, where n is the number of tetrads.</p>
